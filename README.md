# ROT13_CIPHER

## Description
This README provides instructions for running the ROT 26 cypher.  The ROT26 cipher, one of the simplest encryption algorithms, stands for “rotate 26 spaces”, is a letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the letter 26 letters after it in the alphabet.
Instead of only rotating 13 places, ROT26 rotates twice as many characters in the alphabet and is therefore twice as secure.

### Run 
Before running the program run the following command on your terminal:  `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
