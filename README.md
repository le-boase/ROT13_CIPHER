# ROT13_CIPHER

## Description
This README provides instructions for running the ROT 13 cypher.  The ROT13 cipher, one of the simplest encryption algorithms, stands for “rotate 13 spaces”, is a letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the letter 13 letters after it in the alphabet. It can also decrypt any message that was encrypted using the ROT13 cipher
Please note that this program is only limited to ROT13 ciphering.

### Run 
Before running the program run the following command on your terminal:  `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

To run the program, change directory into the ROT13_CIPHER Directory and run the following command:
`python main.py`
       or
`python3 main.py`
